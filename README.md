# Data-scrapers

This code contains four data scrapers for different websites.

The first one finds and returns all of the headlines on the NY Times website. The next one returns the contents of an Economist article. The third one returns all of the headlines on the Economists's home page. The fourth one returns the seven day weather forecast for the  San Francisco region and tabulates the data using pandas.
